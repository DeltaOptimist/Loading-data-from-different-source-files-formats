In my previous article, I introduced you to the basics of Apache Spark, different data representations 
(RDD / DataFrame / Dataset) and basics of operations (Transformation and Action). We even solved a machine 
learning problem from one of our past hackathons. In this article, I will continue from the place I left in 
my previous article. I will focus on manipulating RDD in PySpark by applying operations 
(Transformation and Actions).
